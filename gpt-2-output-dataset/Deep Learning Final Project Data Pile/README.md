This repo is more or less a modification of a repo published by a team at Open-AI dealing with a RoBERTa detector trained to detect output generated by GPT-2. I have adapted it to my purposes. At this junture, this subpackage stores my data before it is processed. Nothing in here will be directly accessed for training. The post-processing data which will be used for training is in detector/Data and detector/OriginalGPTData respectively.

The "Results" subfolder will be used to keep track of both intermeediate and final results. The following results will be included

1. Baseline detector performance:
    - records the behavior of the GPT-2 detector before fine-tuning.
        - On the data initially used by OpenAI to test their detector. 
        - On our abstract data.
        - On the data initially used by OpenAI after paraphrasing.
2. Performance after fine tuning
    - On abstract dataset.
    - Later on paraphrased abstracts.
    - Include training metadata.

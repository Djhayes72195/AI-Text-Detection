Example of paraphrasing:

old gpt-2 text: 'The European Parliament has the power to decide, in principle, whether to grant Bulgaria accession to the Union. Bulgaria is not, by itself, a member of the European Union and has not been since its accession in 2004, though it does have access to the European Economic Area (EEA) through its EU membership. However, the European Commission has expressed an interest in opening accession negotiations with Bulgaria. Accession negotiations must be held on a case-by-case basis because of the EU\'s freedom of movement laws and the rules governing the adoption of the national laws by the national parliaments. An accession decision can be made in principle and not in a law. It can also be decided on the basis of a recommendation from the Council. An accession decision can be taken after the conclusion of a preparatory conference at which experts discuss the application and the interpretation of the Treaty. These meetings take place at the European Council of Heads of State and Government in June 2014, and then at the European Council in December 2014. Both meetings are usually held in Brussels. A decision on a possible accession by the European Parliament to the EEA is taken at a meeting of political group leaders (the "Council decision") in October 2018 after a discussion of all the national representatives of interest. The Council will discuss the EU and the EEA Accession Agenda at its next meeting, which will take place in January 2019.'
